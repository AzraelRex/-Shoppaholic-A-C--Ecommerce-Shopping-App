C++ E-Commerce Shopping App "Shoppaholic"
My C++ E-Commerce Shopping App Has Three Main Features:

Add Item: This feature allows users to add new items to the store. To add an item, users must provide the item code, name, and price.
Display Items: This feature allows users to view all of the items in the store. The items are displayed in a table, with the item code, name, and price.
Search Items: This feature allows users to search for items by item code. To search for an item, users must enter the item code and press enter.
The app is a simple but effective way to buy and sell products online. It is easy to use and navigate, and it offers a variety of features that make it a convenient and efficient way to shop online.

Here is a more detailed description of each feature:
